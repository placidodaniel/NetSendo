# Changelog

All notable changes to the NetSendo project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Pixel — Double Page View Counting (WordPress Plugin):**
  - Removed `netsendo_wp_track_page_view()` function and its `wp_footer` hook from the WordPress plugin. The NetSendo Pixel JavaScript already tracks page views automatically on initialization — the redundant PHP hook was causing every visit to be counted twice.

- **Pixel — Engagement Events Misreported as Page Views:**
  - Fixed `trackTimeOnPage()` sending `page_view` event type instead of a dedicated `engagement` event. This was further inflating page view counts with time-on-page/scroll-depth data. Renamed to `trackEngagement()` and changed event type to `engagement`.

### Added

- **Brain — Agent Reporting & Goal Continuation:**
  - **Post-Execution Hook (`evaluatePostExecution`):** After an agent completes a plan linked to a goal, the orchestrator now automatically updates goal progress, reports completion status, and identifies the next sub-plan via `GoalPlanner::getNextAction()`.
  - **Goal-Aware Failure Handling:** Plan failures now trigger `GoalPlanner::handlePlanFailure()` which tracks failures per goal and automatically pauses goals after 3 consecutive failures.
  - **CRON Goal Progression Engine:** New step 2.7 in the CRON pipeline (`continueActiveGoals`) that finds active goals with pending sub-plans and executes the next action (autonomous mode) or sends for Telegram approval (semi-auto mode). Max 2 goals per cycle to prevent blocking.
  - **Goal Completion Telegram Reports:** When all sub-plans of a goal are completed, a detailed completion report is sent via Telegram listing all executed plans.
  - **CRON Telegram Report Enhancement:** Goal continuation results now included in the CRON cycle Telegram summary.
  - **Localization:** Added `goals.completed_report`, `goals.continued_next_plan`, and `monitor.goals_continued` translation keys in PL, EN, DE, ES.

- **Pixel v2.0 — Session Tracking:**
  - Added `session_id` (UUID) generation in the Pixel JavaScript using `sessionStorage` with a 30-minute idle timeout. Sessions are sent with every event for accurate session-based analytics (bounce rate, user journeys).
  - Database migration adds indexed `session_id` column to `pixel_events` table.
  - Backend validation and `PixelEvent` model updated to accept and store `session_id`.

- **Pixel v2.0 — SPA Navigation Tracking:**
  - Pixel now monkey-patches `history.pushState()` and `history.replaceState()`, and listens for `popstate` events to automatically track page views in Single Page Applications without any additional configuration.

- **Pixel v2.0 — UTM Parameter Extraction:**
  - Pixel automatically parses `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, and `utm_term` from the page URL and attaches them to `page_view` events via `custom_data` for marketing attribution.

- **Pixel v2.0 — Auto-Identification from Email Clicks:**
  - `TrackingController` now sets an `ns_sid` cookie (5-minute expiry, JS-readable) when a subscriber clicks a tracked link in an email. The Pixel JavaScript reads this cookie on page load and automatically calls `/identify`, bridging email tracking with website visitor tracking.

- **Pixel v2.0 — Retry Queue:**
  - Failed event requests are now saved to `localStorage` and retried on the next page load (max 3 attempts, 100-item cap), preventing data loss from transient network errors.

- **Pixel v2.0 — Rate Limiting:**
  - Added `pixel` rate limiter (200 requests/minute per IP) in `bootstrap/app.php`. Applied `throttle:pixel` middleware to all POST pixel routes (`/t/pixel/event`, `/t/pixel/identify`, `/t/pixel/batch`).

- **Pixel v2.0 — Security Improvements:**
  - Added `Secure` flag to the `ns_visitor` cookie on HTTPS connections.
  - Added page view deduplication guard to prevent multiple `page_view` events for the same URL in a single page session.

- **Pixel — Engagement Event Type (Backend):**
  - Added `TYPE_ENGAGEMENT` constant to `PixelEvent` model with explicit `engagement` category in `determineCategory()`. Engagement events do not trigger automation dispatches (intentional — they are metric-only).
  - Added `scroll_depth` and `custom_data` validation to `batchEvents()` endpoint.

- **Brain — Performance Tracker (Closed-Loop Feedback):**
  - **PerformanceTracker Service:** New service that automatically reviews completed campaigns (24–168 hours post-sending). Gathers metrics (open rate, click rate, unsubscribe rate, bounce rate), compares against user benchmarks (min 3 campaigns) or industry averages, and generates AI-powered insights (lessons learned, what worked, what to improve) with rule-based fallback.
  - **AiPerformanceSnapshot Model:** New Eloquent model with benchmark calculation helpers (`isAboveAverage()`, `getBenchmarkComparison()`).
  - **Database Migration:** New `ai_performance_snapshots` table for storing campaign review data.
  - **CRON Integration:** Added as Step 0.5 in the Brain CRON pipeline (between situation analysis and goal creation), ensuring the Brain learns from past performance before planning new actions.
  - **SituationAnalyzer Enhancement:** Campaign performance history injected as context step 9, with 3 new AI prompt instructions guiding the AI to reference past campaign metrics when making recommendations.
  - **Knowledge Base Integration:** Performance insights automatically saved to Knowledge Base under `insights` category for long-term learning.
  - **Monitor API:** Added `performance_snapshots` to `/brain/api/monitor` response with last 10 campaign reviews.
  - **Monitor Frontend:** New "Performance Insights" section in Monitor overview tab showing campaign metrics, benchmark indicators (green/red), and expandable AI-generated lessons (what worked / what to improve).
  - **Telegram Reports:** CRON Telegram report now includes a performance review summary with reviewed campaign names and key metrics.
  - **Localization:** Added `performance_reviewed` translation key in PL, EN, DE, ES.

- **Brain — Weekly Digest (Strategic Reports):**
  - **WeeklyDigestService:** New service generating comprehensive weekly/monthly performance digests. Aggregates campaign metrics, subscriber growth, CRM deal data, AI usage statistics, top campaigns from PerformanceTracker, goal progress, and Brain activity summary. Compares all metrics with previous period (week-over-week or month-over-month).
  - **AI Strategic Report:** Each digest includes an AI-generated executive summary with key wins, areas of concern, strategic recommendations, and focus priorities for the next period. Rule-based fallback report when AI is unavailable.
  - **CRON Auto-Send:** Digest automatically sent via Telegram at end of CRON cycle when ≥5 days since last weekly digest (or ≥25 days for monthly).
  - **Telegram Delivery:** Full Telegram formatting with auto-splitting for messages exceeding 4096 character limit.
  - **API Endpoints:** `GET /brain/api/digest` (fetch last or generate new with `?generate=true&period=week|month`), `POST /brain/api/digest/send` (generate and send via Telegram).

- **Brain — Style/Preference Memory (Phase 3):**
  - New KB categories `style_preference` and `performance_pattern` added to `KnowledgeEntry`.
  - `KnowledgeBaseService::extractStylePreferences()` — AI extracts tone, style, and formatting patterns from executed campaign/message plans.
  - `KnowledgeBaseService::extractPerformancePatterns()` — saves patterns from above-benchmark campaigns (rule-based, fast).
  - `getContext()` category maps updated so campaign and message tasks receive style/performance context.
  - Integrated into `AgentOrchestrator` (after plan execution) and `PerformanceTracker` (after snapshot save).

- **Brain — Intelligent Task Scoring (Phase 4):**
  - **TaskScorer Service:** Replaces simple high/medium/low priority filtering with 4-dimension scoring (0-100): Impact (subscriber count, category), Urgency (time since last execution), Goal Alignment (keyword similarity), Freshness (penalize recently-done similar tasks).
  - CRON pipeline now scores and sorts tasks by score (highest first) instead of filtering by priority threshold.
  - Task scores displayed in Telegram CRON reports and approval messages.

- **Brain — KPI Dashboard (Phase 5):**
  - New `GET /brain/api/kpi` endpoint returning: subscriber growth (week/week), avg OR/CTR (30d with period-over-period trends), CRM pipeline value + deal conversion, and Brain efficiency (completed plans / total).
  - Monitor overview tab now shows 5 KPI cards at the top with trend indicators (↑↓→) and color-coded efficiency.

- **Brain — Campaign Calendar (Phase 6):**
  - **CampaignCalendarService:** AI-powered weekly campaign planning based on active goals, audience size, and past performance.
  - **Database migration:** New `ai_campaign_calendar` table with fields for planned date, campaign type, topic, target audience, and status (draft/approved/executed/skipped).
  - **AiCampaignCalendar model** with scopes for user, upcoming, week, and status.
  - CRON pipeline auto-generates next week's calendar when none exists.
  - SituationAnalyzer injects upcoming calendar entries as AI context (step 10).

- **Brain — Telegram UX (Phase 7):**
  - `/goals` — Lists active goals with progress bars (▓░) and priority indicators.
  - `/report` — Generates and sends the latest weekly digest summary with recommendations.
  - `/kpi` — Quick KPI snapshot (subscribers, OR, CTR, Brain efficiency).
  - `/calendar` — Shows upcoming planned campaigns with type emojis and statuses.
  - Updated `/help` to include all new commands.

## [2.0.3] – Short Description

**Release date:** 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Brain — Full Automation Management (SegmentationAgent):**
  - **5 New Executors:** `create_automation` (creates `AutomationRule` with trigger, actions, conditions, rate limiting), `update_automation` (modifies any fields), `toggle_automation` (enable/disable), `delete_automation` (with system rule protection), `list_automations` (full list with stats and execution counts).
  - **Enriched AI Context:** Plan prompt now includes all 30+ available trigger events, 18 action types, 15+ condition types, and the user's existing automations — enabling AI to make informed automation decisions.
  - **Validation:** Trigger event validation, empty actions check, system rule deletion protection.

- **Brain — A/B Test Management (CampaignAgent):**
  - **3 New Executors:** `create_ab_test` (creates `AbTest` + `AbTestVariant` records with type, sample %, auto-winner, up to 5 variants), `check_ab_results` (displays per-variant open rate, click rate, CTOR with winner determination), `list_ab_tests` (lists all tests with status, type, metric, and winner).
  - **Smart Message Linking:** `create_ab_test` automatically finds the message from a previous `create_message` step if no explicit `message_id` is provided.
  - Removed `create_automation` from CampaignAgent prompt (now handled by SegmentationAgent).

- **Brain — Auto-Context Enrichment (AgentOrchestrator):**
  - `gatherAutoContext()` now provides automation data (total/active count + top 5 rules with names/triggers) for segmentation/campaign/analytics agents.
  - `gatherAutoContext()` now provides A/B test data (running/completed counts) for campaign/message/analytics agents.

- **Localization:**
  - Added 30+ new translation keys for automation management (`automation_created`, `automation_updated`, `automation_toggled`, `automation_deleted`, `automation_list_header`, `automation_active`, `automation_inactive`, error messages) and A/B tests (`ab_test_created`, `ab_results_header`, `ab_list_header`, `ab_winner`, `ab_still_running`, etc.) in PL, EN, DE, ES.

- **Brain — Goal Proposals via Telegram (Semi-Auto Mode):**
  - In semi-auto mode, CRON-generated goals are now **proposed** to the user via Telegram with ✅ Approve / ❌ Reject buttons instead of being silently created.
  - Each proposal stored as `AiPendingApproval` with 48h expiry. On approval, goal is created via `GoalPlanner`.
  - Autonomous mode unchanged (creates goals immediately).

- **Brain — CRM Contact Targeting in Campaigns (CampaignAgent):**
  - `select_audience` now supports `crm_contact_ids` (direct CRM contact IDs) and `crm_segment` (`hot_leads`, `warm`, `cold`, `all`) for targeting CRM contacts alongside mailing lists.
  - AI prompt now always includes **available mailing lists with IDs and subscriber counts** and **CRM contact segment counts** (hot leads, qualified, cold) so AI can make precise audience selections.
  - `buildAvailableListsContext()` and `buildCrmSegmentsContext()` helper methods for prompt enrichment.

- **Brain — Real Campaign Scheduling (CampaignAgent):**
  - `schedule_send` now actually schedules messages: sets `scheduled_at` from AI plan, assigns `contact_list_id`, and updates message status to `scheduled`. Falls back to draft if date is invalid.
  - Automatically picks message ID and list ID from previous plan steps (`create_message`, `select_audience`) if not specified.

- **Localization:**
  - Added goal proposal translations (`goal_proposal_title`, `goal_approved`, `goal_rejected`, `goal_expired`, `goal_invalid`) in PL, EN, DE, ES.
  - Added CRM targeting (`crm_contacts_selected`, `crm_segment_selected`) and scheduling (`schedule_created`) translations in PL, EN, DE, ES.

- **Brain Monitor — Manual Goal Management:**
  - Added **Add Goal** button ("+") in Goals tab header and empty state, opening a modal with title (required), description, and priority selector (Low/Medium/High/Urgent).
  - Added **Edit Goal** button (✏️) on each goal card for active/paused goals, opening a pre-populated edit modal.
  - Both modals use `Teleport` to render above all content with backdrop overlay.
  - Localization: Full translations for all goal management UI in PL, EN, DE, ES (`brain.goals.*` — 25 keys per locale).

- **Brain — AI Situation Analysis:**
  - **SituationAnalyzer Service:** New AI-powered strategic analysis that runs during each CRON cycle before rule-based task detection. Gathers full user context (goals, CRM, campaigns, execution history, plans) and asks AI to identify highest-impact priorities with reasoning.
  - **CRON Integration:** AI-analyzed priorities are merged with existing rule-based tasks, with AI priorities taking precedence. Analysis summary included in activity logs and Telegram reports.
  - **Monitor API:** Last situation analysis report now available via the `/brain/api/monitor` endpoint for frontend display.
  - **GoalPlanner:** Added `getGoalsSummary()` method for compact goal state snapshots.
  - **Telegram Reports:** Fixed hardcoded Polish strings; all report text now uses `__()` translation helpers.
  - **Localization:** Full translations in PL, EN, DE, ES.

- **Brain — Autonomous Mode Direct Dispatch:**
  - **`executeCronTask()`:** New method in `AgentOrchestrator` that bypasses intent classification and info gathering for CRON-generated tasks. Dispatches directly to the correct agent with auto-filled context.
  - **`gatherAutoContext()`:** Auto-collects CRM data (lists, subscribers, recent topics, hot leads, open deals) so agents have all context needed for autonomous execution without user input.
  - **Cron-Aware Agents:** `BaseAgent.needsMoreInfo()` and `CampaignAgent.needsMoreInfo()` now return `false` for cron channel, preventing autonomous tasks from blocking on user input.
  - **Auto-Context in Campaign Plans:** `CampaignAgent.plan()` enriched with auto-context block for cron tasks, including available lists, recent topics to avoid, and mandatory instructions for AI to pick concrete values.
  - **Self-Contained Task Actions:** `MarketingSalesSkill.getSuggestedTasks()` and `SituationAnalyzer` now generate detailed, self-contained action descriptions with list IDs, topics, tones, and goals — eliminating the need for agents to ask clarifying questions.
  - **Increased Token Limit:** `SituationAnalyzer` max_tokens increased from 2500 to 4000 to prevent truncated analysis reports.

- **Brain Knowledge Base — View & Edit Entries:**
  - Added **View modal** (👁) to preview the full content of a knowledge entry with metadata (source, confidence, usage count, active status).
  - Added **Edit modal** (✏️) to modify title, category, and content of existing entries with character counter and validation.
  - Table actions column now shows View, Edit, and Delete buttons per entry.

- **Telegram — Conversation Management:**
  - Added **"🆕 New conversation"** inline button under every Brain response in Telegram, allowing users to start a fresh conversation thread.
  - Added `/new` command as an alternative way to start a new conversation.
  - Default behavior unchanged: messages continue the existing conversation.
  - Localization: Full translations in PL, EN, DE, ES.

### Fixed

- **Brain Monitor — Goals List Always Empty:**
  - Fixed `GET /brain/api/goals` silently returning `{"data":[], "total": 0}` even when goals existed in the database. Root cause: `$goal->append('progress_percent')` tried to invoke a non-existent Eloquent accessor `getProgressPercentAttribute()`, throwing an exception caught by the controller's catch-all block. Removed the unnecessary `append()` call since `progress_percent` is a regular database column already included in the model's JSON output.

- **Brain MessageAgent — Incorrect Personalization Variables:**
  - Fixed `MessageAgent` using incorrect `{{first_name}}` placeholder syntax instead of the real NetSendo insert variable system (`[[fname]]`, `[[!fname]]`, `{{male|female}}`). AI-generated email content now uses the correct variable syntax that the mail sending engine actually resolves.
  - Added `getPersonalizationInstructions()` helper method with a complete reference of all available NetSendo variables (subscriber data, vocative case, gender-dependent forms, links, dates).
  - Updated all 7 prompt methods (`plan`, `advise`, `executeGenerateSubject`, `executeGenerateBody`, `executeGenerateAbVariants`, `executeImproveContent`) to include correct variable syntax and usage examples.

- **Voice Message Transcription — 422 Error:**
  - Fixed `422 Unrecognized file format` error when sending voice messages in Brain chat. Root cause: PHP temp uploads (e.g., `/tmp/phpXXXXXX`) have no file extension, causing OpenAI Whisper API to reject them. Now passes the original uploaded filename (e.g., `voice.webm`) to the Whisper API request.

- **Voice Message Language — English Instead of User Language:**
  - Fixed agent `getInfoQuestions()` methods returning hardcoded English text regardless of user language preference. Replaced with `__()` translation calls using new `brain.campaign.info_*` and `brain.research.info_*` translation keys in all 4 locales (PL, EN, DE, ES).
  - Fixed Telegram webhook context not setting Laravel locale, causing `__()` to always return English. Added `setUserLocale()` helper to `TelegramBotService` that sets `App::setLocale()` based on user's Brain language settings before processing messages.

  - **Localization:** Full translations for voice recording UI in PL, EN, DE, ES.
- **NetSendo Brain — Internet Research (Perplexity & SerpAPI):**
  - **WebResearchService:** New service integrating Perplexity AI for deep research with citations and SerpAPI for Google Search results. Supports company research, trend analysis, and content idea generation.
  - **ResearchAgent:** New specialist agent handling web search, deep research, competitor analysis, market trends, and content research tasks. Can save findings to the knowledge base.
  - **ResearchSkill:** New orchestrator skill that provides research-aware prompts and suggested tasks in 4 languages (EN, PL, DE, ES).

  - **API Key Security:** Research API keys stored encrypted in the database with masked display in the UI.
  - **Database Migration:** Added `perplexity_api_key` and `serpapi_api_key` columns to `ai_brain_settings`.
  - **Localization:** Full translations for research UI in PL, EN, DE, ES.

- **NetSendo Brain — Chat Streaming:**
  - **Real-Time Responses:** Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming for Brain chat, providing immediate token-by-token feedback instead of waiting for full generation.
  - **Provider Support:** Updated all 6 AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, Openrouter, Ollama) to support streaming via `generateTextStream()`.
  - **Reliability:** Implemented smart persistence that saves partial responses if the connection is interrupted (e.g., tab switch), ensuring no data loss.
  - **Frontend UX:** Rewrote `sendMessage()` in `Index.vue` using `fetch` and `ReadableStream` for progressive rendering with a blinking cursor indicator.
  - **Backend Architecture:** Added `streamConversation()` to `AgentOrchestrator` and `chatStream()` endpoint in `BrainController` with cURL-based non-buffered streaming.

- **NetSendo Brain — Language Support:**
  - **Language Selector UI:** Added a new "Response Language" settings card in Brain Settings with dropdown selection for Auto (UI language), English, Polski, Deutsch, Español, and a custom text input for any other language.
  - **Backend Language Resolution:** Added `resolveLanguage()` and `getLanguageName()` helpers to `AiBrainSettings` model. Default `preferred_language` changed from `'pl'` to `'auto'` (uses UI locale). Added `getLanguageInstruction()` helper in `BaseAgent` that provides dynamic language instructions to all agents.
  - **English-First Prompts:** Translated ALL hardcoded Polish prompts to English across the entire Brain service layer: `ConversationManager`, `AgentOrchestrator`, `MarketingSalesSkill`, all 6 specialist agents (`CampaignAgent`, `ListAgent`, `MessageAgent`, `CrmAgent`, `AnalyticsAgent`, `SegmentationAgent`), `KnowledgeBaseService`, and `TelegramBotService`. All AI prompts now include dynamic language instructions based on user preference.
  - **Telegram Bot:** Translated all Telegram bot messages, commands, welcome/help text, and approval buttons from Polish to English.
  - **Localization:** Full translations for language selector UI in PL, EN, DE, ES.

### Fixed

- **Brain Heredoc Syntax:**
  - Fixed a PHP 7.3+ compatibility issue in `ConversationManager.php` where a heredoc content line starting with the heredoc label (`TELEGRAM`) caused a parse error. Renamed the label to `TELEGRAM_BLOCK`.

- **Brain Monitor — Token Usage Always Zero:**
  - Fixed Brain Monitor showing `0` tokens and `$0.00` cost for all activity. Root cause: all AI providers (`generateText()`) returned only a text string, discarding the `usage` data from API responses.
  - Added `generateTextWithUsage()` method to all 6 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, OpenRouter, Ollama) that extracts real `tokens_input` and `tokens_output` from each provider's API response format.
  - Updated `AgentOrchestrator::handleConversation()` to use real token counts from `generateTextWithUsage()`.
  - Updated `AgentOrchestrator::streamConversation()` to estimate input and output tokens instead of hardcoding `0, 0`.

### Changed

- **Translation Management:**
  - Cleaned up `docs/TRANSLATIONS.md` by removing the outdated change log and adding a strict warning that translations should only be edited in `.json` and `.php` files, not in the documentation itself.
  - Updated `src/fix_translations.php` script to include `marketplace` translations (Perplexity AI, SerpAPI, and AI categories).

### Fixed

- Fixed Telegram bot using `HTML` parse mode for Markdown messages, causing delivery failures.
- Fixed bot token resolution failure for unlinked users in self-hosted environments (added fallback to any configured token).
- Fixed Brain chat infinite loop when replying to agent info requests — user details were ignored by `needsMoreInfo()`, causing the same questions to repeat endlessly instead of proceeding to plan creation.

### Added

### Fixed

- **Brain Integration Fixes:**
  - Fixed `SyntaxError: Invalid linked format` in frontend by escaping `@BotFather` references (`{'@'}BotFather`) in all locale files (PL, EN, DE, ES). This prevents Vue I18n from interpreting `@` as a linked message token.
  - Fixed `SQLSTATE[42S01]: Table 'ai_brain_settings' already exists` error during migration by adding `Schema::hasTable()` check to `2026_02_18_120000_create_ai_brain_settings_table.php`.

### Changed

## [2.0.0] – Short Description

**Release date:** 2026-02-18

### Added

- **NetSendo Brain — Dashboard Status Widget:**
  - **Status Widget:** Added a new widget to the main Dashboard right sidebar displaying Brain's status, work mode, and knowledge base stats.
  - **Quick Chat:** Integrated quick chat input directly in the dashboard widget for asking questions to Brain without navigating away.

- **Telegram Marketplace Integration:**
  - **Marketplace Entry:** Added Telegram to the Marketplace active integrations list with a dedicated detail page.
  - **Integration Flow:** Users can now discover and connect Telegram from the Marketplace, redirecting to Brain settings for the handshake.
  - **Status Indicators:** Active/Inactive badges and connection details now visible in Marketplace.

### Fixed

- **Brain Settings - 401 Unauthorized:**
  - Fixed 401 errors when saving settings or generating Telegram codes in `Settings.vue`.
  - **Root Cause:** Frontend was using session cookies while API routes (`/api/v1/brain/*`) required Bearer token (`api.key` middleware).
  - **Fix:** Implemented duplicate session-authenticated web routes (`/brain/api/*`) for internal frontend usage, mirroring the API capabilities but using `web` middleware group.

### Added

- **NetSendo Brain — AI Marketing Assistant (Phase 1):**
  - **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Introduced a central AI orchestrator ("NetSendo Brain") with three specialist agents (Campaign, List, Message) that can plan, execute, and advise on marketing tasks autonomously.
  - **Three Work Modes:**
    - **Autonomous:** AI plans and executes actions automatically, reports after completion.
    - **Semi-Auto:** AI proposes an action plan with steps, waits for user approval before executing.
    - **Manual:** AI analyzes and advises; user performs all actions manually.
  - **Brain Core Services:**
    - `AgentOrchestrator` — Central brain that classifies user intent via AI (with keyword fallback), routes to specialist agents, manages execution flow, tracks token usage.
    - `ConversationManager` — Multi-channel conversation management (web, Telegram, API) with system prompt building and AI payload construction.
    - `ModeController` — Work mode management with critical action detection (e.g., `delete_all_subscribers` always requires approval) and cross-channel approval flow with 24h expiration.
    - `KnowledgeBaseService` — Bidirectional knowledge engine: users add entries manually, AI auto-enriches from conversations. Category-based context injection for AI prompts with full-text search.
  - **Specialist Agents:**
    - `CampaignAgent` — Plans campaign strategies, selects audiences, generates content, creates messages, integrates with existing `CampaignArchitectService`.
    - `ListAgent` — Creates lists, cleans bounced subscribers, tags contacts, shows statistics with context-aware AI planning.
    - `MessageAgent` — Generates email/SMS content, subject line variants, A/B test variants, improves existing content using knowledge base context.
  - **Telegram Bot Integration:**

  - Fixes zombie processes accumulating in the `scheduler` container (~5760/day) caused by `runInBackground()` tasks forking child PHP processes every minute without an init process (PID 1) to reap them.
  - Docker now injects Tini as PID 1, which properly calls `wait()` on terminated child processes.

### Changed

- **Queue Diagnostic Logging:**
  - Added `Log::debug()` calls to `CronScheduleService::processQueue()` for two previously silent skip conditions: list schedule disallowed and list volume limit reached. Logs include entry ID, list ID, message ID, and relevant context to help diagnose why entries remain in `planned` status.

  - **Subscriber Language Preference:** Subscribers can now have a preferred language set via Create/Edit forms, public preferences page, and CSV import.
  - **Message Translations UI:** Full translation management in Message Create with language tabs, add/remove translations, copy from default, and per-language subject/preheader/content editing.
  - **Language-Aware Sending:** `SendEmailJob` resolves language-specific content before sending, with fallback to default language.

- **CRM Auto-Convert Setting:**
  - Added user-configurable toggle "Auto-convert warm contacts" in **CRM → Scoring Rules** settings.

  - Setting is stored in `User.settings` JSON column under `crm.auto_convert_contacts`.
  - Backend: Modified `addScore()` and `createCrmDeal()` in `AutomationActionExecutor.php` to respect the setting.

  - **Per-Subscriber Scheduling:** When "Send in subscriber's timezone" is enabled, autoresponder `time_of_day` and broadcast `scheduled_at` are interpreted in each subscriber's local timezone, with per-subscriber UTC conversion in `CronScheduleService`.
  - **Fallback Logic:** Subscribers without a timezone fall back to the message's effective timezone hierarchy (Message → List → Group → User Account).
  - **Frontend:** Added checkbox in Message Create/Edit (Settings tab, below timezone selector), conditionally visible when `time_of_day` is set or scheduled send is selected.
  - **Controller:** Updated `MessageController` store/update validation and edit data exposure for the new flag.
  - **Localization:** Full translations in PL, EN, DE, ES.
  - **Tests:** Added `CronScheduleServiceTimezoneTest` with 6 test cases covering per-subscriber timezone gating, UTC fallback, and helper method behavior.

### Fixed

- **Deliverability - SPF Configuration:**
  - Fixed incorrect hardcoded `include:netsendo` SPF mechanism by replacing it with dynamic installation domain (e.g., `include:_spf.yourdomain.com`).
  - Fixed SPF record generation to correctly aggregate providers from all mailboxes sharing the same domain (e.g., merging SendGrid and NMI includes).

  - Added display of scheduled date under "Scheduled" status for SMS lists.

### Fixed

- **Campaign Architect:**

- **Message Machine:**
  - Fixed an issue where duplicatiing a message did not copy the tracked links configuration (`MessageTrackedLink` records), causing the copy to lose all link tracking settings.

  - Updated integration instructions in Marketplace to reflect the new strict granular permission requirements.
  - Added UI labels for new granular scopes in the "Granted Permissions" display.

- **A/B Test Confidence Threshold Validation:**
  - Fixed validation mismatch where backend blocked saving A/B tests with confidence threshold below 80%, even though the UI allowed values down to 60%.
  - Updated validation rules in `MessageController`, `AbTestController`, and `Api/V1/AbTestController` to accept minimum value of 60%.

### Fixed

- **Queue Statistics Visibility:** Fixed issue where the "Queue Progress" section was hidden for new autoresponder messages that had no processing data yet.
- **Skipped Subscribers Calculation:** Updated `MessageController` to use dynamic calculation for "missed" subscribers (`getQueueScheduleStats`) instead of relying solely on database records, ensuring the message list reflects the true state shown in the statistics modal.
- **Database Error:**
  - Fixed `SQLSTATE[22001]: String data, right truncated` error by changing `last_test_message` column type from `string` to `text` in `mailboxes` table (migration `2026_01_10_195500`).

## [1.5.5] – Short Description

**Release date:** 2026-01-10

    - < 50 subscribers: -20 points (critical), 50-249: -12 points (warning), 250-999: -6 points (warning), 1000-4999: -3 points (info), 5000+: no penalty.
    - Provides actionable recommendations for lead magnets, landing pages, and list-building strategies.

### Changed

- **Campaign Auditor Scoring:**

- **Subscriber Management:** Standardized manual subscriber addition to reliably dispatch the `SubscriberSignedUp` event, ensuring all automations and initial queue synchronizations are triggered immediately.

- **Autoresponder Delay:** Fixed critical bug where autoresponder messages ignored the `day` offset and sent immediately to all subscribers. Messages now correctly respect the configured delay (`day=0` for immediate, `day=1` for next day, etc.).

- **Subscriber Reactivation:** Fixed issue where manually adding or importing subscribers who were previously unsubscribed would not reactivate them on the list.

- **SMS List Permissions:** Fixed an issue where team members with `edit` permissions were unable to edit shared SMS lists due to direct ownership checks. The `SmsListController` now correctly uses the `canEditList()` method to validate permissions.

- **List Deletion Security:** Standardized SMS list deletion to allow only the list owner to perform the action.

### Added

- **Subscriber Rejoin Handling:**
  - New `resubscription_behavior` setting per mailing list to control what happens when active subscribers try to re-subscribe.

## [1.5.3] – Short Description

**Release date:** 2026-01-08

### Added

- **Vocative Case Support (Polish Names):**

- **Team Member Access:**
  - Fixed 403 Forbidden error upon login for team members by hiding the admin-only "User Management" menu item.

  - Fixed "Unauthorized access" validation error when team members attempt to add subscribers to shared lists or create messages using shared lists.
  - **API:** Fixed ambiguous `status` column SQL error in `ContactListController` when filtering subscribers by status by using `wherePivot()`.
- Fixed ambiguous column SQL error in Subscriber statistics calculation.
  - Fixed subscriber visibility logic to ensure team members can see all subscribers belonging to any list they have access to, regardless of who created the subscriber.

## [1.5.2] – Short Description

**Release date:** 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- **Form Builder:**
  - Fixed issue where the same field could be added multiple times to a form. Fields already added to the form are now displayed as disabled (grayed out with a checkmark icon) in the "Available Fields" sidebar instead of being hidden or clickable. This prevents duplicate field entries and provides clear visual feedback about which fields are already in use.
  - **Template Builder:** Fixed issue where the Block Library sidebar was not scrollable on smaller screens, preventing access to bottom blocks and buttons. Added `min-h-0` class to the sidebar container and updated parent layout in `Builder.vue` from `md:block` to `md:flex` to ensure proper flexbox behavior and scrollable area height.

  - Ensures "What You See Is What You Get" for message scheduling regardless of user's timezone settings.

- **Message Statistics:**

  - Implemented missing queries to `EmailOpen` and `EmailClick` in `MessageController::stats`.
  - Added recent activity feed for opens and clicks on the stats page.

- **Broadcast Snapshot Behavior:**

## [1.0.7] – Advanced Tracking, Triggers & Bug Fixes - 2025-12-22

### Added

- **Message Triggers Integration:**
  - Triggers tab in message editor is now fully functional (removed "Coming Soon" badge)
  - Trigger selection automatically creates `AutomationRule` behind the scenes
  - Supported trigger types: signup, anniversary, birthday, inactivity, page visit, custom (tag)
  - Each trigger has configuration options (e.g. `inactive_days`, `url_pattern`, `tag_id`)
  - Green dot indicator shows when trigger is active on a message

- **Email Read Time Tracking:**
  - Track how long subscribers read emails using `EmailReadSession` model
  - New endpoints: `/t/read-start`, `/t/heartbeat`, `/t/read-end`
  - Integration with automations via `read_time_threshold` trigger

- **Read Time Statistics on Stats Page:**
  - KPI cards: Average read time, Median, Total sessions, Max time
  - Read time distribution histogram chart (0-10s, 10-30s, 30-60s, 1-2min, 2min+)
  - Top readers table showing subscribers with longest read times
  - Data sourced from `EmailReadSession` model

- **Page Visit Tracking:**
  - Track subscriber visits to external pages with `PageVisit` model
  - JS Tracking Script generator for external sites (`/t/page-script/{user}`)
  - Visitor identification linking anonymous visitors to subscribers when they click email links
  - New `page_visited` automation trigger supporting URL patterns (wildcards)

- **Date-Based Automations:**
  - `DateTriggerService` for processing time-based triggers
  - New automation triggers: `date_reached`, `subscriber_birthday`, `subscription_anniversary`
  - Integrated with main scheduler (runs daily at 8:00 AM)

- **New Automation Triggers:**
  - `subscriber_inactive` - trigger when subscriber is inactive for X days
  - `specific_link_clicked` - trigger when specific URL is clicked
  - `read_time_threshold` - trigger when email is read for X seconds
  - `page_visited` - trigger on page visit matching URL pattern

### Changed

- `AutomationRule` model extended with `trigger_source` and `trigger_source_id` fields to track where automation was created from (message, funnel, or manual)
- `MessageController` now syncs message triggers with the automation system via `syncMessageTrigger()` method
- `MessageController@stats` now returns read time statistics, histogram, and top readers data
- **Automation Builder:**
  - Updated frontend interface to support configuration for new triggers
  - Added specific fields for URL patterns, dates, and time thresholds
- **Scheduler:**
  - Added `automations:process-date-triggers` command to `routes/console.php`

### Fixed

- **Message Scheduling Bug:**
  - Added `scheduled_at` to `$fillable` array in `Message` model - this was preventing "Send immediately" and scheduled messages from being processed by CRON
  - Added `scheduled_at` to `$casts` as datetime for proper type handling

- **Vue-i18n Parsing Errors (SyntaxError: Invalid linked format):**
  - Fixed unescaped `@` characters in email placeholder translations
  - In vue-i18n, `@` must be escaped as `{'@'}` to prevent parser confusion with linked messages syntax
  - Fixed files: `en.json` (4 occurrences), `es.json` (3), `de.json` (2), `pl.json` (1)
